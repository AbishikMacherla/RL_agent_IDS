For your information:     
- Make sure the whole document is written and maintained in academic.                                         
- Check is it following the structure that recommended in the guideline for our dissertation paper  
- I will attach the guidelines documents on how to write a dissertation paper and also a example First class dissertation paper to get inspiration and structure to achieve the first class in my dissertation. 
  
Content:     
- Abtract:  
   - I need to clarify on - is current cyber or tech industries still use traditional IDS and rely on static signatures or supervised machine learning models that lack the ability to adapt to zero day - if you have any reference of evidence to support in the literature review, then its fine, if not then we need to find sources
   - Also, check do i have a reason why i am using random forest as baseline        
   - Maybe once i we done with the whole dissertation paper, we can rewrite the abstract  
- Introduction:(get inspiration from the example and follow the guidelines)
   - Make the introduction more descriptive                
   - The introduction should be strong and cover around more than half page  
	- Background:  
	   - Be more descriptive and if you need resources/sources let me know, i can search them and provide it to you, then you can decide whether you want it or not
	- Research Objectives:  
	   - Double check with the changes that's made in methodology to make sure we are mentioning the right thing and let me know if you need sources and what type of sources
	   - And we have mentioned enough technical, so also include theoretical parts helps in word count and also can use sources
	- Contribution:  
	   - Missing the reference so check with the Latex code        
	   - are you sure and can you define, how this project demonstrates the viability of RL Agents not just classifies, but as adaptive decision making in network security.
	- Structure of the Article:  
	   - I dont think we need this unless this type of structure/format mentioned in the guideline.
- Literature Review: (get inspiration from the example and follow the guidelines)
	- Check does it follow the guidelines
	- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):
		- its okay, and there are way to improve it
		- Missing citation/references, fix the Latex
	- Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive defence:
		- Machine learning vs reinforcement leanring:
			- missing citation/references, fix the Latex
			- I see gap to improve this
		- The RL Agent and Agentic security:
			- Add more reference from sources and could improve it more, if you need to add diagram its fine we can add them but let me know what diagram you need i can craete them based on you description
		- Algorithm Selection DQN vs PPO:
			- More sources and references, just let me know what you are looking for i can provide them.
			- Also, missing references, fix the latex
	- Enhancing IDS with RL:
		- Can you have evidence from source to prove that Combining both IDS and RL will enhance the adaptability from previous researches could be a strong evidence.
		- Avoiding Dwell time:
			- Could mentioned real life incidents evidence and stats on this to make it more strong
			- But stick it with our dissertation concept and dont change it toward some off topic
		- Improving the RL Model Accuracy:
			- Could add more information and add references
			- missing reference fix the Latex
		- Data problem:
			- No need to mention the version of dataset we are using just mention about the why and why not, why we chose this for training and testing, how we going to handle this data like clean, preprocess, process and other things
		- Simulation environment:
			- Could add diagrams, and just keep it straight why Cyborg is not used and also how we going to use this and how it works and where are we running these and prerequisites.
			- Also check with the guidelines.
		- Challenges in real life:
			- could have this section and Avoiding Dwell time together and call it "Challenges".
			- Have evidence and sources to support what we are trying to mention.
	- Related Research:
		- could be more descriptive and there are gap to improvise
		- missing references so fix the latex
- Methodology:
	- Research Design:
		- Could have add more information and diagram as this part is blend.
	- Environment setup:
		- Diagram if wanted and cross check the information 
	- Data Preprocessing:
		- I see gaps to improvise the context than 3 bullet points
	- RL Agent Implementation:
		- could have a diagram and way more descriptive as just four bullet points is not explanation enough
	- Reward Engineering:
		- its nice with could add more information
	- Training Procedure:
		- More information and could have done the whole stages of how i have ran it and the process in a descriptive methods and other things
- Results:
	- Performance Metircs:
		- More information on the this topic as its just really less could have explained what and how we are planning to get results and at what metrics and why.
	- Baseline Model Results:
		- What its behaving like this and explain the score
	- RL Agent Results:
		- Could have both the Baseline and RL agents results in the same section
	- Confusion matrix:
		- More information and explaniations and proper tabulation
- Discussion:
	- Interpretation of Findings:
		- Its nice but could have improvised
	- Comparison with Baseline:
		- nice and more information of why with the numbers
	- Implications:
		- graphs and numbers and more explanation
	- Limitations:
		- more information and double check them and
	- Future Work:
		- I would not recommend this but check with the guidelines
	- Additional section:
		- Why not have a section to explain and summarise findings
- References:
	- Try to add references section too does not ignore it

My notes:
	- follow the guideline i have provide to see are we on the right structure and format and path
	- Use the example dissertation as inspiration
	- If you need sources let me know what type of sources you are looking for i can search for academic papers and give you the URL and see how they work and then add them
	- If you need to add diagram explain how you need them i can create them or you could give them in mermaid so i can generate and you can add these images on the dissetation.
	- Check the Latex issues and fix it and also add references are they are missing in section and in context.
