Addressing Class Imbalance in Intrusion Detection: A Comprehensive Evaluation. *Electronics*, 14(1).** DOI: [10.3390/electronics14010069](https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics14010069) 16 **Synthesis**: This paper evaluates various resampling strategies to overcome the problem of benign traffic significantly outweighing attack instances. It demonstrates that judicious integration of resampling is required to identify minority class threats without increasing false positives. **Verification Quote**: "One of the most important challenges in IDSs is the class imbalance problem... This paper is intended to evaluate machine learning algorithms under different levels of class imbalances." 16

Commun.*, 212\.** URL: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387482605](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387482605) 16 **Synthesis**: Gu investigates ensemble methods like BalanceCascade that target previously misclassified or hard-to-classify samples. This approach boosts the overall detection accuracy of agents operating on high-dimensional, imbalanced network flows. **Verification Quote**: "Target previously misclassified or hard-to-classify samples as part of model training to boost the overall detection accuracy." 16

Supercomput.*, 79\.** URL: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387482605](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387482605) 16 **Synthesis**: The authors propose using a unified framework that combines deep learning with advanced resampling techniques to handle dynamic network environments. This integration helps the IDS maintain high reliability as the ratio of benign to malicious traffic fluctuates. **Verification Quote**: "Put forward strategies such as resampling techniques to tackle performance issues stemming from imbalanced datasets." 16

Comput.*, 19\.** URL: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387482605](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387482605) 16 **Synthesis**: This work leverages GANs to synthesize realistic samples for minority attack classes in cyber-physical systems. This "enhancing of perceptive power" allows the agent to recognize rare but devastating attacks that are normally obscured by majority classes. **Verification Quote**: "Contribution to 'enhancing the perceptive power of such unpopular classes' through the use of deep learning models such as generative adversarial networks." 16

It finds that optimized imbalance handling is essential for maintaining the robustness of autonomous cyber defense. **Verification Quote**: "By combining these methods with machine learning algorithms... we demonstrate improvements in model performance, particularly in detecting minority attack classes." 17

## **Category 10: Dwell Time and Economic Motivation**

*Goal: Provide real-world statistics to justify the need for autonomous defence.*

Cost of a Data Breach Report 2025\. *IBM / Ponemon Institute*.** URL: [https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/data-matters/cost-of-a-data-breach](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/data-matters/cost-of-a-data-breach) 18 **Synthesis**: This benchmark report reveals that global average breach costs have dropped to USD 4.44 million, primarily due to faster containment driven by AI defenses. However, in the US, costs have surged to a record USD 10.22 million due to slow detection times and regulatory penalties. **Verification Quote**: "Security teams using AI and automation extensively shortened their breach times by 80 days and lowered their average breach costs by USD 1.9 million." 19

    **Synthesis**: This longitudinal study shows that while "malware-free" intrusions are increasing, supply chain attacks maintain the highest dwell times (312 days). It emphasizes that attack automation is driving the projected 293 million incidents for 2025, mandating autonomous response.  
    **Verification Quote**: "Supply chain surge: These attacks show the highest success rate but longest detection times making them extremely dangerous."

It argues that rapid digitization necessitates a rise in cybersecurity investment to prevent systemic market disruptions. **Verification Quote**: "Projections for the next few years place crypto crime and ransomware attacks at the top... with worldwide cost estimates projected to reach USD 265 billion per year by 2031." 20

    **Synthesis**: This systematic review reports that integrating automation with threat intelligence can achieve a 50–70% decrease in mean time to detect (MTTD). It justifies the move toward autonomous agents by showing that behavior-driven detection engineering significantly outpaces traditional SIEM platforms.  
    **Verification Quote**: "Reported improvements include a 40–65% increase in threat detection accuracy \[and\] a 50–70% decrease in mean time to detect (MTTD)."
