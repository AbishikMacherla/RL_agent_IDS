# **Reinforcement Learning for Intrusion Detection System for autonomous network defence**

The current cyber threat landscape is characterized by an escalating degree of sophistication, where adversarial entities employ automated, multi-stage attack vectors that outpace human-led defensive responses. The persistence of high-impact breaches is fundamentally tied to "dwell time," the window between initial system compromise and the final containment of the threat. Recent empirical evidence indicates that the global average duration to identify and contain a data breach in 2025 has settled at approximately 241 days, which, while representing a nine-year low, still affords attackers significant time for lateral movement and data exfiltration.1 The economic consequences of this latency are severe; the global average cost of a data breach is approximately USD 4.44 million, but this figure surges to USD 10.22 million in the United States, largely due to detection and escalation costs which average USD 1.47 million per incident.2 These figures underscore a critical failure in traditional, static security architectures and mandate a transition toward autonomous network defence systems capable of reasoning and responding at machine speed.  
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as the most promising paradigm for achieving this autonomy. Unlike traditional Deep Learning (DL) models that rely on static, historical datasets, RL agents learn through continuous interaction with a network environment, optimizing their defensive strategies based on a feedback loop of rewards and penalties. This adaptive capability is essential for addressing the "zero-day" problem, where novel exploits with no known signatures are used to bypass perimeter defenses. By modeling the defensive task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), RL allows for a proactive security posture that evolves in parallel with the adversary.

## **The Economic and Operational Motivation for Autonomous Defence**

The shift toward autonomous systems is driven by a stark reality: 60% of all data breaches now include a human element, whether through negligence, social engineering, or configuration errors.2 Furthermore, the complexity of modern hybrid cloud environments has rendered manual oversight impossible. Breaches involving data distributed across multiple environments are the costliest, averaging USD 5.05 million and taking 276 days to resolve—59 days longer than simple on-premises incidents.4

| Data Breach Statistic (2025) | Impact Metric |
| :---- | :---- |
| Global Average Breach Cost | USD 4.44 Million 2 |
| US Average Breach Cost | USD 10.22 Million 6 |
| Average Dwell Time (Global) | 241 Days 1 |
| Healthcare Sector Average Cost | USD 7.42 Million 1 |
| Cost for Lifecycle \> 200 Days | USD 5.01 Million 2 |
| Cost Saving via Security AI/Automation | USD 1.90 Million 7 |

The financial sector and healthcare have been particularly targeted, with healthcare recording the highest average breach costs for 14 consecutive years.1 The integration of Reinforcement Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is not merely a technical upgrade but a fiscal necessity; organizations utilizing extensive AI and automation in their security operations have demonstrated an ability to shorten the breach lifecycle by 80 days, significantly mitigating the long-term indirect costs associated with reputational damage and regulatory fines.6

## **Category 2: Advancements in Value-Based Reinforcement Learning (DQN)**

Deep Q-Networks (DQN) represent the first major breakthrough in combining RL with deep neural networks, allowing agents to handle high-dimensional state spaces by approximating the Q-value function. In the context of autonomous defence, DQN agents are frequently used to classify network flows as benign or malicious, with recent advancements focusing on stability and multi-class precision.  
The core mechanism of a DQN agent in an IDS involves observing the current network state $s\_t$, which may include packet headers and temporal flow features, and selecting an action $a\_t$ (e.g., flag or permit) that maximizes the expected return $Q(s\_t, a\_t; \\theta)$. The agent updates its parameters $\\theta$ by minimizing the temporal difference (TD) error between its current estimate and the target $r \+ \\gamma \\max\_{a'} Q(s\_{t+1}, a'; \\theta^-)$.13

## **Category 3: Policy Optimization and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**

While value-based methods like DQN excel in discrete classification, policy-based methods are more suited for autonomous defence tasks involving continuous action spaces or complex multi-step remediation. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has become the gold standard due to its "trust region" update mechanism, which prevents the agent from making large, destabilizing changes to its defensive policy.11  
The PPO objective function is defined as:

$$L^{CLIP}(\\theta) \= \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}\_t \\left\[ \\min(r\_t(\\theta) \\hat{A}\_t, \\text{clip}(r\_t(\\theta), 1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon) \\hat{A}\_t) \\right\]$$  
where $r\_t(\\theta)$ is the probability ratio between the new and old policy, and $\\hat{A}\_t$ is the estimated advantage. This clipping mechanism ensures that the autonomous agent remains within a safe operational boundary during the learning phase.14

## **Category 4: Zero-Day Attack Detection and Discovery**

A primary motivator for RL-based IDS is the identification of zero-day vulnerabilities—security weaknesses that have not yet been disclosed or patched. Traditional methods, which rely on historical data, are fundamentally limited in their ability to detect these novel threats. RL agents, by focusing on anomaly detection and learning the "norm" of a network, can identify the subtle behavioral deviations associated with new exploits.16

## **Category 6: Dataset Engineering and Class Imbalance Management**

The performance of RL-based IDS is frequently hindered by the class imbalance problem, where the volume of normal traffic dwarfs the instances of malicious activity. This structural imbalance can lead to agents that are biased toward predicting the majority class, failing to detect rare but critical intrusions. Recent research has focused on data augmentation, cost-sensitive learning, and synthetic generation to address these gaps.22

## **Synthesis of Findings and Operational Implications**

The transition from manual Security Operation Centers to autonomous network defence is no longer a theoretical pursuit but a necessity dictated by the economic and operational metrics of modern cybercrime. The 50 unique papers identified in this report reveal a maturing ecosystem of Reinforcement Learning applications characterized by a shift toward policy-based stability (PPO), zero-day discovery, and topological generalizability (TERLA).11  
The integration of "Rainbow" enhancements in DQN has pushed detection accuracies to near-perfect levels (99.8%) on established benchmarks, while the emergence of high-fidelity simulators like CybORG++ has addressed the long-standing training bottlenecks of RL agents.9 Furthermore, the proactive management of class imbalance through GAN-augmented synthetic data generation ensures that autonomous agents remain vigilant against rare, high-impact threats.9  
The operational implication is clear: organizations that adopt these autonomous paradigms can expect to reduce their breach lifecycle by up to 80 days and mitigate financial losses by nearly USD 2 million per incident.6 As the arms race between attackers and defenders continues to escalate, the deployment of Reinforcement Learning-based IDS will be the defining factor in achieving a resilient and proactive security posture.
